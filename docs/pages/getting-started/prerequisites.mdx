# Prerequisites

Before using Orleans.Search, ensure your environment meets the following requirements.

## Runtime Requirements

| Requirement | Version |
|-------------|---------|
| .NET | 10.0 or later |
| Microsoft Orleans | 10.0 or later |
| PostgreSQL | 12 or later |
| Entity Framework Core | 9.0 or later |

## PostgreSQL Setup

Orleans.Search uses PostgreSQL as its search index backend. You'll need a running PostgreSQL instance.

### Using Docker

The quickest way to get PostgreSQL running locally:

```bash
docker run -d \
  --name orleans-search-postgres \
  -e POSTGRES_USER=postgres \
  -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=postgres \
  -e POSTGRES_DB=orleanssearch \
  -p 5432:5432 \
  postgres:16
```

### Using an Existing Instance

If you have an existing PostgreSQL installation, create a database for Orleans.Search:

```sql
CREATE DATABASE orleanssearch;
```

## Orleans Project

Orleans.Search integrates with an existing Orleans application. You should have:

1. An Orleans silo project (host)
2. Grain interfaces project
3. Grain implementations project

If you're new to Orleans, see the [Orleans documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/orleans/) to get started.

## Source Generators

Orleans.Search uses Roslyn source generators to generate code at compile time. Ensure your project:

- Targets .NET 10.0 or later
- Has `<LangVersion>latest</LangVersion>` in your project file (recommended)

## Next Steps

Once your prerequisites are in place, proceed to [Installation](/getting-started/installation).
